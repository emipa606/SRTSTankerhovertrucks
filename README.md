This sleek hover-truck requires at least 1 pawn as a pilot, it's engine structures are different from your usual trucks as it specialized in liquid transportation, make sure it is well kept hidden from any sort of environmental hazard, extreme temperatures, fire, chemicals, acid and especially bullets.

Supports [Dubs Bad Hygiene](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=836308268) and [Rimefeller](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1321849735)
